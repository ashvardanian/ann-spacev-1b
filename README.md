# SpaceV 1B

SpaceV, originally published by Microsoft, is arguably the best dataset for large-scale Vector Search benchmarks.
The [original dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/SPTAG/tree/main/datasets/SPACEV1B) was fragmented into 4 GB, which required additional preprocessing before it could be used.
This adaptation re-distributes it under the same [O-UDA license](https://github.com/microsoft/SPTAG/blob/main/datasets/SPACEV1B/LICENSE), but in a more accessible format, and augmented with more metadata.
